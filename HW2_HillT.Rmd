__Ex. 1__ -- Show that $x^2 + exp(x) + 2x^4 + 1$ is convex.  



__Ex. 2__ -- Show that the mean of the exponential distribution

$$p(x) = \begin{cases} 
      \ \lambda e^{-\lambda x}, & 0 < \lambda \leq x \\
      0, & x <  0 
   \end{cases}
$$

is $\mu = \frac{1}{\lambda}$ and its variance is $\sigma = \frac{1}{\lambda^2}$.  



__Ex. 3__ -- It is estimated that there is a typo in every 250 data entries in a database, assuming the number of typos can obey the Poisson distribution. For a given 1000 data entries, what is the probability that there are exactly 4 typos? What is the probability of no typo at all? Use _R_ to draw 1000 samples with $\lambda = 4$ and show their histogram.
