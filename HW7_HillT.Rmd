__Ex. 1__ -- Use the _svm()_ algorithm of the _e1071_ package to carry out the support vector machine for the PlantGrowth dataset. Then, discuss the number of support vectors/samples [Install the _e1071_ package in R if needed.] 

__Ex. 2__ -- Do a similar SVM analysis as that in the previous section using the _iris_ dataset. Discuss the number of support vectors/samples. 

__Ex. 3__ -- Use the _iris_ dataset (or any other dataset) to select 80% of the samples for training _svm()_, then use the remaining 20% for validation. Discuss your results.
